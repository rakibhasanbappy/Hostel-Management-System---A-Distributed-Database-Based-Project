# Hostel-Management-System---A-Distributed-Database-Based-Project
House Management System is one kind of management system where the authority can keep track of the students of the house/hostel easily. An additional site named medical is added to make the database distributed. It also helps us to understand the importance of distributed databases. In our system, the following task can be done.

An admin (Employee) can –
- See the list of all existing students.
- See the details of all houses.
- See the total seat and available seats of all houses.
- See the list of all students distinguished by the house.
- See the list of request which is done by a new student.
- Add a new student.
- Delete any existing student.
- See the vaccine status of the students.

A guest (New Student) can -
- See the details of all houses.
- See the total seat and available seats of all houses.
- Request for a seat in a house.

A Doctor can –
- See the vaccine status of the students.
- Update the vaccine status of a student. I did this project in my distributed database system lab.

There are not many functionalities available in this project. I just tried to implement the idea of distributed database.
