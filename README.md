# Hostel-Management-System---A-Distributed-Database-Based-Project
House Management System is a system where a school/college/university can manage their houses/hostels/halls. I did this project in my distributed database system lab. There are not many functionalities available in this project. I just tried to implement the idea of distributed database.
